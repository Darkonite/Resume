# Updated Resume
Resume made in Visual Studio using HTML and CSS.
In this version of the resume I already knew more about HTML and CSS and how to use it.
In this version I used more divs and classes for CSS in order to style the resume.
CSS is separated from HTML.
This implementation was made after the resume I had at that time. The information on it is not updated.
